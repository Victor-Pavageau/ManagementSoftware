## About

This project involves developing software that enables a company to manage its inventory, employees, and clients, process and receive orders, and generate statistics for all its operations. A user-friendly interface was created using WinForms to simplify the tasks for the end users of the software.

This project was undertaken during my second year of preparatory classes, equivalent to the second year of undergraduate studies (Bac+2) in the French education system as part of a school assignment, providing valuable hands-on experience in software development and teamwork.
